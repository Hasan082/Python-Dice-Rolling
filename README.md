# Dice Rolling App - Python

## Overview

Welcome to the Dice Rolling App, a simple Tkinter application designed to simulate the experience of rolling a six-sided die. With just a click of the "Roll the Dice" button, users can enjoy the excitement of seeing a random die face displayed on the graphical user interface (GUI).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure that Python is installed on your system.

```bash
pip install tk pillow
```

### Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the `dice_rolling.py` script.

2. Open a terminal or command prompt.

3. Navigate to the directory where the script is located.

4. Execute the following command to run the Dice Rolling app:

    ```bash
    python dice_rolling.py
    ```

5. The Dice Rolling window will appear, showcasing the current face of the die.

## Dependencies

This application relies on the following Python libraries:

- `tkinter`: The standard GUI toolkit for Python.
- `Pillow`: A modern version of the Python Imaging Library (PIL) used for working with images.

Ensure these libraries are installed using the following:

```bash
pip install tk pillow
```

## Files Included

- `dice_rolling.py`: The primary Python script for the Dice Rolling application.
- Die face images (`die1.png`, `die2.png`, ..., `die6.png`): Images representing each face of a six-sided die.

## Customization

Feel free to customize the app by adding or replacing die face images. Ensure that you update the `dice` list in the script accordingly.
